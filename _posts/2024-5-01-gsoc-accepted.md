I am delighted to share that I've been accepted to Google Summer of Code 2024 and selected as a contributor at the OpenTransitSoftwareFoundation 🎉🥳


I'll be contributing to enhancing the OneBusAway Android app, which provides real-time bus arrival information to over 1,000,000 users, enabling efficient urban travel.

I will be working on integrating tools that will aid in analysis, including the integration of surveys directly into the app.

These projects aim to streamline real-time feedback and data collection, empowering transit agencies to gather valuable insights from their riders.

Exciting times ahead! 🥳
